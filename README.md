# AI implementation for Qubic(3D tic-tac-toe)
#### Created for my CPSC 481 AI course final project

## Game Logic
Everything under GameLogic was created by [Sasidharan Mahalingam](https://github.com/sasidharan-m/qubic-solver/tree/master)

I've only copied the files necessary to have a working Qubic game in python 

His repository contains his implementation of AI for Qubic and more games so check it out!
